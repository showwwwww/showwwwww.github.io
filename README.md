# Hello Everyone
There are three reasons why I decided to create this repository:

1.I have worked for several years and consider myself an experienced developer. I want to share interesting ideas and experiences with the community.

2.I want to develop a habit of committing to GitHub daily, and I believe maintaining this blog is a good way to achieve that.

3.I’m looking for an opportunity to join an enthusiastic start-up team, and I hope this repository can serve as a communication bridge to help others discover me.
